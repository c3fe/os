----

To make it more portabe, all toolchains wi be installed/run inside a Linux container.
We do have to build a container image, the minimal one which includes:

* QEMU
* GCC
* Gnu Make
* ...

In this setup, we will use Fedora (personal choise only), the container engine is *Podman* (rootless, that's why I prefer over *Docker*).
